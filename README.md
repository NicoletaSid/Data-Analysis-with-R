# Data Analysis eLearning Academy: Final Project
## Description of the project
This project is the culmination of the Data Analytics eLearning Academy, completed as the final step of my coursework. It involves the application of statistical methods and predictive modeling techniques to analyze and interpret data, with the goal of uncovering patterns, trends, and statistical relationships between variables within the dataset. Through statistical hypothesis testing and predictive analysis, this project aims to derive meaningful insights and make informed predictions. Key predictive algorithms used include linear regression and logistic regression models. Additionally, data visualization techniques and classification algorithms are employed to deliver valuable insights and actionable conclusions within the target domain.
